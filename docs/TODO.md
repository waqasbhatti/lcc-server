This is for the NSF CSSI program:

Deadline: April 18, 2018


## Stuff that will go in a proposal

Future functionality will include:

- federation APIs so multiple lcc-servers can appear in a single portal. this
  will involve metadata tagging for bandpass, sky footprint, time coverage,
  etc., sharing data in a global backing database so if nodes go offline, they
  can recover from other nodes

- public classification interfaces for periodic variable classification, a rich
  exploration interface built on web-GL

- extension to transient time-domain surveys

- streaming data ingest and alert system for transients and other high cadence
  phenomena

- collaboration tools, including object comments across federated datasets,
  activity streams, and streaming status updates for objects

- serving of calibrated FITS image stamps per object per epoch of any
  time-series, so people can run photometry on their own

- adding in VO TAP query services


Significance:

- enable publication of previously unearthed light curves

- share independent reductions of the same dataset; important for TESS with
  reductions via aperture phot vs image sub phot, etc.
