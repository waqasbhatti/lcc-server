## Data

This work has made use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission
[Gaia](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia), processed by the Gaia Data Processing
and Analysis Consortium
([DPAC](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium)). Funding for the
DPAC has been provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions
participating in the Gaia Multilateral Agreement.

This work has made use of the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive [DUST
service](http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/), which is operated by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under
contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

This work has made use of the [SkyView
service](https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/titlepage.pl) provided by the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. In particular, finder charts for objects are
generated from the [Digitized Sky
Surveys](http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/acknowledging.html), originally made
available by the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at
STScI](http://archive.stsci.edu/).

This work has made use of the [SIMBAD
database](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad), operated at CDS, Strasbourg,
France. See [2000, A&AS, 143, 9 , "The SIMBAD astronomical database", Wenger et
al](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26AS..143....9W).
